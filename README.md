# How to get started

Create a new device within ESPHome builder and combine the yaml with one of the examples from the `examples` directory. Give your unit a name, configure OTA passwords, hotspot, add an API key and install!  

- [`simple.yaml`](https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/blob/master/examples/simple.yaml): Basic yaml to get started, contains climate and fan direction control.
- [`external_sensor.yaml`](https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/blob/master/examples/external_sensor.yaml): Contains the basics to configure the room temperature using an external temperature sensor connected to Home Assistant.  
- [`full.yaml`](https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/blob/master/examples/full.yaml): Contains all (20+!) of the metrics that are possibly in the unit and returns them.  
- [`simple-energy-management.yaml`](https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/blob/master/examples/simple-energy-measurement.yaml): Contains the basics to get started with energy measuring (assuming a voltage of 230v to convert A to Wh).

# MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome
This project is a simple integration of the amazing work [absalom-muc](https://github.com/absalom-muc) has done with his project [MHI-AC-Ctrl](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl).\
It's supposed to simplify the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup, while giving you OTA and auto-discovery with virtually zero effort and no MQTT needed, powered by [ESPHome](https://ESPHome.io/).\
`MHI-AC-Ctrl-core.*` files were forked directly, with a small modification to allow for pin setting in yaml, whereas your WiFi credentials should go into the `*.yaml` file, and `mhi_ac_ctrl.h` is the core of the integration.

# Fan Modes Up/Down Left/Right
Most newer MHI units (the ones supporting the WF-RAC WiFi module) support fine grained vane control for Left/Right and Up/Down.  
When your log is flooded with `mhi_ac_ctrl_core.loop error: -2` errors after updating to the newer code, please change your yaml file to set `frame_size: 20`.  
Currently the MHI code allows for more fine grained fan direction than ESPHome climate supports. for that, additional template parts are added.  
There are 8 modes for Left/Right: Left, Left/Center, Center, Center/Right, Right, Wide, Spot and Swing  
There are 5 modes for Up/Down: Up, Up/Center, Center/Down, Down and Swing  
Setting swing from the ESPHome climate now fully works. It will store the oldvanes mode, and configure swing. After disabling swing (either vertically, horizontally or off), the old settings will be restored. Manually changing modes for Left/Right or Up/Down will update the climate state as well.

# Climate Quiet

Climate Quiet was added to ESPhome, so QUIET was added. Ordering still needs work (https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/issues/22#issuecomment-1744448983)
Added the solution for the auto mode from: https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/issues/22#issuecomment-1310271934:
CLIMATE_FAN_DIFFUSE in fan speed and status sections and reshuffle the numbers and add CLIMATE_FAN_DIFFUSE to the traits.set_supported_fan_modes

Has now 5 different fan modes but I'm not sure if the auto mode works proper, keep testing.

# Low temperature heating and cooling

To allow for lower temperature heating or cooling, set the visual_min_temperature in the climate section of the yaml like so:

```yaml
climate:  
  - platform: MhiAcCtrl  
    name: "MHI Air Conditioner"  
    temperature_offset: true  
    visual_min_temperature: 17.0  
```
This will allow for lower temperature heating or cooling.

# FAQ

### I have no clue where to start, what can i do?
Step 1: Learn Dutch to understand the blogpost (or use some translation service :) 
Step 2: Go to this extensive blogpost: https://www.twoenter.nl/blog/smarthome/mitsubishi-airco-voorzien-van-wifi-besturing/ 
  
### I am getting the following logline in the console of my device:
```
[W][component:237]: Component MhiAcCtrl took a long time for an operation (52 ms).
[W][component:238]: Components should block for at most 30 ms.
```

This is because ESPHome now alerts for slow components. To ignore this warning you can configure logging for components to ERROR, this will suppress the WARNING. See https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/issues/61 for more information.
```yaml
# Enable logging
logger:
    level: INFO
    baud_rate: 0
    logs:
        component: ERROR
```

### I am getting `mhi_ac_ctrl_core.loop error: -2` errors and nothing works!  
You probably have an older version of the Airco unit which doesn't support the newer, larger framesize.   
You can to change the frame_size in the yaml to 20 to disable newer functionality.  
When framsize is set to 20, 3D auto, and vane Left / Right doesn't work, vane Up / Down works limited.  
All other features should work fine.  

### Everything has changed, how do I update?!?  
As time progresses, ESPHome and this project evolved, allowing for more features and easier installation and updates in the future. When you are on an older versione (whether that is v3.0, v2.0 or earlier) the best way forward is to get one of the example yaml files from the examples folder and apply this to your current yaml file. 
 1. Make a copy of your current yaml file, and save it somewhere outside of Home Assistant.
 2. Did you not skip step 1?
 3. Choose one of the example yaml files from the [examples dir](https://github.com/ginkage/MHI-AC-Ctrl-ESPHome/tree/master/examples)
 4. Carefully copy the basic information from the backup file into the example file. Take things like name, ota password, wifi credentials, ap fallback settings, api settings and key, and frame_size
 5. Double check your new yaml and paste it in ESPHome builder and deploy
 6. If you replaced all information carefully, all should build fine. If not, read the message and see what parts are missing or duplicate (most frequently done wrong)
